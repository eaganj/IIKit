    ''' InstrumentContexts are used to provide information about the environment in which an Instrument is
        being used.  They are currently only used in the Substance environment to create a binding between
        physical devices and instruments (such as binding a motion-tracked wand to a pointing instrument or
        a button on an iPad to an input event for a particular instrument).
        
        Normally, the state machine for an instrument is defined in terms of events and optionally logical
        devices.  This instrument context allows the mapping to be established between phyical devices and
        these logical devices.

            parameters are specified.  Currently empty parameters include:

                `activationSource`: (not used),
                `devices`: the list of physical devices available in the context,
