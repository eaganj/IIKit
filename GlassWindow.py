        window, or the full screen.  It acts as a child of this object, following it as its position updates.
        Glass windows are useful for drawing annotations on top of an existing widget or even replacing its 
        appearance entirely.  They can also optionally intercept and redirect input events, transforming the
        behavior of the parent object.
